        <h4>&nbsp</h4>
        <h4>Years ago in New York City, the Board Game Bros Max Peng and Vincent Wang had humble beginnings playing games on the carpeted floors of their university dorm. However, growing inside them were these great aspirations to share their love for board games and to welcome others into this brotherhood of table-top gamers. As a culmination of this desire, the Board Game Bros. website was born in 2016 with the sole objective of making board games as accessible and fun as possible. This meant that the Brothers wanted players to really enjoy the entire process of learning about, picking out, and trying a new game. In order to achieve that goal, they worked tirelessly and poured their hearts out into their reviews, their tutorials, and their renowned Board Game Flow Chart. With all that work, the Brothers ensured that people no longer have to spend hours worrying about choosing a game that is right for them and then learning the complicated rules; they can focus on what truly matters, which is making real connections with people and developing an appreciation for games as an art form. So pull up a chair and join the Board Game Bros. table!</h4>
